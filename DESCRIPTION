Description: A collection of tools to read and interpret Bloomberg Enterprise data usage.
    Data usage can be interpreted from detailed monthly reports (verification reports),
    invoices, and collections of request files. This package provides tools to reconstruct
    a detailed data usage history and use recontructed histories to run simulations,
    conduct what if analysis and provide recommendations for optimizations.
