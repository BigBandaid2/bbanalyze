## Introduction to Verification Reports

Verification reports are detailed transaction and data-point level records of
an account's interactions with Bloomberg. These records are provided as supporting
material for the monthly Enterprise Data License Per Security invocies.

When parsed, these records can be reconciled to the invoice and to historical 
archives of request transactions. The same information can be used to re-create
a detailed history for the purpose of simulation and what-if scenario projections
